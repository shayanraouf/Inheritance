/**Description: This Circle class inherits from it's parent class Shape
 * which has the basic functionalities for a general shape. However,
 * this Circle class is modified specifically to be implemented for 
 * a circle therefore, many of the functions or methods in the parent class
 * are overwritten to complement the Circle class. 
 * 
 * An example of this would be all shapes have an area so it is suitable
 * to have a function in the parent class that sets or gets the area of shape
 * however, the area of all shapes are NOT equivalent to ((3.14...)r^2). This equation is only
 * suitable for a circle hence the Circle class will override the parent class getArea() 
 * function. This example applies to all different subclasses inheriting from a parent class.
 * Plus the Shape class is very generic and dosn't do much anyways, it is simply a frame for
 * us to work with so we don't have to repeat redundant code.
